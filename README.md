"3D Computer Graphics: Software Revealed" Source Code
=====================================================

This GitHub repository contains all source code for each of the 20 lessons (framework & 19 demos) the book "3D Computer Graphics: Software Revealed" has.
Users are welcomed to fork, change, and update for inclusion of future versions of the book. If your changes make it to the main branch, you'll receive
a free digital copy (the formatted PDF version, not the HTML version since that's already free), and your name included in the contributors list!

About the Book
==============

This digital book is meant as an introduction to programming 3D computer graphics with little overhead. Readers require minimal math and minimal software setup: you can start programming immediately on your computer without any downloads! You will learn how to program a 3D software rasterizer, one of many different approaches to implementing 3D computer graphics, and learn how 3D computer graphics work "under the hood". This book walks you through what OpenGL and DirectX have implemented in their respective code-base (and drivers), without system or library specific overhead!

I hope you enjoy the book, and most importantly, I hope you learn something new from it! Good luck, and have fun!
